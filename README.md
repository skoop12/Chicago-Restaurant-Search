# Chicago-Restaurant-Search

This website was created as part of a Databases course for the MPCS program.    This course focused on database design and query development in MySQL. Therefore, the SQL queries and database schema were developed independently and templates were used and modified for the front end functionality.  At this time, the data within the application serves as a mock up for the site and database functionality and does not accurately represent real Chicago restaurants.  

The site consists of various search forms to obtain information about Chicago restaurant locations, hours, happy hour deals, and events.

The site also includes the ability to add/modify/delete restaurant data to allow users to have an active role in maintaining accurate event and happy hour information.  

The site can be accessed here:
https://mpcs53001.cs.uchicago.edu/~skoop/

The below images provide a short overview of the site:

The front page contains menu links to the 'Restaurant', 'Happy Hour', and 'Events' sections of the site.
